  message:
  - Hey, thanks again for watching Ginger while I was away last month!
  - She seemed sad that you were gone
  - But she's a cat so who knows what she feels haha!
  - I know it's last minute, but would you be able to watch her again for me next
    week?
  - I'm going skiing with a buddy for a few days and you're the only one in the neighborhood
    I trust
  - It's short notice so I'm willing to pay $100 if you can!
  nextmessage:
  - Absolutely!
  - Not this time, sorry!
